## DS534 Project Journal

### Jan. 21
Initial project planning and researching. We did priliminary research on packages and initially
thought we would make a wrapper on the Luftansa API, but found that there already is a prexisting
and comphrehensie R Luftansa API wrapper project from 8 years ago, so we decided to use a different flight
data API, and our research was focused on finding a better API without an R wrapper.

### Jan. 22
We agreed to use OpenSky API and researched how we could use it by reading its documentation.

### Jan. 23
Day 1 of development, created the github repo with template files.
