## DS534 Project Journal

### Jan. 21
Initial project planning and researching. We did priliminary research on packages and initially
thought we would make a wrapper on the Luftansa API, but found that there already is a prexisting
and comphrehensive R Luftansa API wrapper project from 8 years ago, so we decided to use a different flight
data API, and our research was focused on finding a better API without an R wrapper.

### Jan. 22
We agreed to use OpenSky API and researched how we could use it by reading its documentation.

### Jan. 23
Day 1 of development, created the github repo with template files.

### Jan. 24
Worked on setting up the authentication process using OAuth2 to securily store API credentials and
get info from it in JSON format.

### Jan. 25 - Jan 31
Worked on the remaining package components and wrote comphrehesive documentation.

### Feb 1 - Feb 2
Developed unit tests to verify that each function works with all tests passing.
