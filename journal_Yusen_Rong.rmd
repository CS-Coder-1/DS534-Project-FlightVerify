## 2026-01-21

I started with project planning and researched available flight data APIs. I initially explored the
Lufthansa API, but found an older, comprehensive R wrapper already available, so I decided to look
for a better API without an existing R package.

## 2026-01-22

I reviewed the OpenSky Network API documentation and confirmed that its arrivals, departures, and
tracks endpoints match our use case. I also noted that OAuth2 client-credentials is required for
higher rate limits.

## 2026-01-23

I set up the GitHub repository and R package scaffold (license, contributing guide, code of
conduct, and basic package metadata).

## 2026-01-24

I implemented authentication helpers and a shared request layer with retries so all API calls
follow the same error-handling path.

## 2026-01-25

I added airport arrivals/departures wrappers, ICAO validation, time-window checks, and a small
Canadian airports reference dataset.

## 2026-01-30

I completed Day-2 analysis functions: landing-rate calculation, delay verification, and a
rule-based probability estimator. I also added baseline data support and tests, and expanded the
README with usage notes.

## 2026-02-02

I pulled the latest team updates and merged them with my branch. This brought in state-vector and
track endpoints, vignettes, and man pages. I resolved conflicts and aligned overlapping files with
the upstream package versions.

## 2026-02-03

I reviewed the merged codebase for issues and documented any gaps. Next I will regenerate roxygen
docs for new functions and validate behavior with package checks on my local R setup.
